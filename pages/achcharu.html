            <li>200g green papaya (julienned)</li>
            <li>100g shallots (peeled and halved)</li>
            <li>3-4 green chilies (sliced)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic (sliced)</li>
            <li>1-inch ginger (sliced)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><i>For Pickling:</i></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Â½ cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp mustard seeds (ground into a paste)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp red chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><i>For Tempering:</i></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp mustard seeds</li>
            <li>1 sprig curry leaves</li>
        </ul>

            First, prepare the vegetables by slicing carrots, papaya, green chilies, ginger, and garlic into thin strips. Peel and halve the shallots. In a small bowl, mix mustard paste with vinegar, sugar, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Heat coconut oil in a pan, add mustard seeds, and let them splutter. Then, add curry leaves and mix well. Pour this tempering over the prepared vegetables and mix thoroughly. Add the mustard-vinegar mixture and toss everything together, ensuring the vegetables are well coated. 
            
            Let the achcharu sit for at least a few hours to allow the flavors to blend. For best results, leave it overnight for a richer taste. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for longer shelf life. 
            
            Achcharu is a popular Sri Lankan pickle often enjoyed as a side dish with rice and curry. It adds a tangy, spicy, and slightly sweet touch to meals, making it a favorite in Sri Lankan cuisine. Some variations include adding pineapple, mango, or even dates for a unique twist. 
            
            The preparation of Achcharu has been a long-standing tradition in Sri Lankan households, often made in large batches for festive occasions and celebrations. It is a versatile condiment that pairs well with not only rice but also flatbreads and snacks. Many families have their own special Achcharu recipes, passed down through generations, each adding a distinctive twist by incorporating local fruits and vegetables. 
            
            Achcharu is best served fresh but also develops a deeper flavor profile over time. If you prefer a milder taste, adjust the chili and mustard levels accordingly. To enhance the flavor even more, some people add a dash of roasted curry powder or crushed dried chilies for an extra kick. 
            
            Enjoy this flavorful, traditional Sri Lankan pickle with your favorite meals and share the joy of this beloved dish with family and friends! ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡°ðŸ”¥
