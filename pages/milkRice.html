            Rinse the rice well and place it in a pot with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer until the rice is soft and most of the water is absorbed.
            
            Add the thick coconut milk and salt to the cooked rice, stirring well to combine. Let it cook on low heat until the mixture becomes thick and creamy.
            
            Once ready, transfer the milk rice onto a flat plate or tray and spread it evenly. Let it cool slightly, then cut into diamond or square shapes.
            
            Serve warm with jaggery, lunu miris, or banana for a delicious traditional Sri Lankan meal. Enjoy! üçöü••
