            In a large bowl, mix the roasted rice flour with salt. Gradually add water while mixing with your fingers to create a crumbly, grainy texture.

            Take a Pittu steamer and layer it with grated coconut at the bottom, followed by a layer of the rice flour mixture. Continue layering, finishing with coconut on top.

            Steam the Pittu for about 10-15 minutes until cooked and firm.

            Serve hot with coconut milk, banana, lunu miris, or your favorite curry. Enjoy your delicious homemade Sri Lankan Pittu! üçõü••
