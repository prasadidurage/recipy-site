            <ul>
                <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ cup warm water</li>
                <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
                <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>

                <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2><i>For Cooking & Topping:</i></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tbsp butter (for brushing)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp garlic (minced, optional for garlic naan)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp fresh coriander leaves (chopped)</li>
            </ul>

                First, prepare the dough by mixing warm water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Add yogurt, warm milk, oil, and the yeast mixture, then knead into a soft, slightly sticky dough. Cover and let it rest in a warm place for 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.
    
                Once the dough has risen, divide it into equal portions and roll each into an oval or round shape. Heat a tawa (griddle) or a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Place a rolled-out naan on the hot pan and cook for about 1 minute until bubbles form. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown spots appear. If desired, place the naan directly over the flame for a few seconds to get a tandoor-like effect.
    
                Brush the hot naan with melted butter and sprinkle with chopped coriander. For garlic naan, mix minced garlic with melted butter before brushing. Serve hot with curries, chutneys, or yogurt-based dips for a delicious meal! 🍽🔥
