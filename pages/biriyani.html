        First, marinate the chicken by mixing it with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice. Let it rest for at least an hour for better flavor. Meanwhile, soak basmati rice for 30 minutes, then cook it in boiling water with bay leaves, cloves, cardamoms, cinnamon, and salt until it's about 80% done. In a separate pan, heat oil and fry sliced onions until golden brown, keeping some aside for garnish. Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, sautéing until aromatic. Then, add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft. Next, add the marinated chicken and cook until it's tender, mixing in mint and coriander leaves for extra flavor. Once done, start layering by spreading half the cooked rice in a heavy-bottomed pot, placing the chicken mixture on top, and then covering it with the remaining rice. Drizzle saffron milk, ghee, and fried onions over the top for a rich aroma. Cover with a tight lid and let it cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Finally, gently mix the biryani and serve hot with raita or a fresh salad for a delicious meal! 🍛🔥
