            First, prepare the dough by mixing flour, salt, and oil in a bowl. Gradually add water and knead until you get a firm, smooth dough. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the filling by heating a pan with a little oil. Add cumin seeds, grated ginger, and green chilies, sautÃ©ing for a few seconds. Then, add mashed potatoes, boiled peas, and all the spicesâ€”coriander powder, garam masala, red chili powder, turmeric, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few minutes before adding lemon juice and fresh coriander. Let the filling cool.

            Now, divide the dough into equal portions and roll each into a thin oval shape. Cut it in half to form two semicircles. Take one semicircle, apply a little water along the edges, and fold it into a cone shape. Fill it with the prepared potato mixture, seal the edges well, and repeat for the remaining samosas. 

            Finally, heat oil in a deep pan over medium heat. Fry the samosas in batches until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels and serve hot with mint chutney or tamarind sauce. Enjoy your crispy, flavorful samosas! ðŸ¥ŸðŸ”¥
