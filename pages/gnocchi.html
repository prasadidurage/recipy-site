                First, begin by boiling the potatoes. Place them in a large pot of cold water and bring to a boil. Cook for about 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Drain the potatoes and let them cool slightly. Once cooled, peel the potatoes and mash them using a potato masher or a potato ricer for a smooth consistency. Let the mashed potatoes cool completely.

                Once the potatoes have cooled, place them on a clean surface or in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add the egg, salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg if using. Gradually add the flour, a little at a time, and mix everything together until a dough forms. Be careful not to overwork the dough, or the gnocchi will be tough.

                Lightly flour your work surface and divide the dough into smaller portions. Roll each portion into a long rope, about 1/2 inch in diameter. Using a knife, cut the dough into small pieces (about 1-inch long) to form the gnocchi. You can use a fork to gently press each piece, creating the signature ridges on the gnocchi, or leave them plain.

                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently drop the gnocchi into the boiling water in batches. Once the gnocchi rise to the surface, cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to ensure they‚Äôre fully cooked. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

                For the sauce, melt the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the fresh sage leaves (or dried sage) and saut√© for 1-2 minutes, until the butter is golden brown and fragrant, and the sage becomes crispy. Be careful not to burn the butter.

                Add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet with the butter sage sauce and gently toss to coat them in the buttery sauce. Let them cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the gnocchi to absorb some of the flavors.

                Serve the gnocchi immediately, garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper.

                These homemade gnocchi are pillowy soft and flavorful, making for an amazing, comforting dish. You can also serve them with a tomato sauce, pesto, or your favorite sauce for a variety of delicious options! üçùüßë‚Äçüç≥
