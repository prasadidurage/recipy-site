                Start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add your pasta of choice (penne, fusilli, or spaghetti) to the boiling water and cook according to the package instructions (usually 8-10 minutes) until it reaches al dente. Stir the pasta occasionally to prevent it from sticking. Once cooked, reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain the rest. Set the pasta aside.
            
                While the pasta is cooking, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 1-2 minutes, until the garlic becomes fragrant. Make sure to keep an eye on it to avoid burning the garlic, as it can become bitter quickly.
            
                Add a can of crushed tomatoes to the pan, stirring to combine with the garlic and olive oil. Season the mixture with dried basil, oregano, and a pinch of sugar (if desired). The sugar helps balance the acidity of the tomatoes. Allow the sauce to simmer over low-medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. This simmering time allows the flavors to meld together, creating a rich and flavorful sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.
            
                Once the sauce has thickened to your liking, pour in 1/2 cup of heavy cream (or half-and-half) and stir to combine. Let the sauce cook for another 2-3 minutes to allow the cream to integrate smoothly and create a velvety texture.
            
                Now, add the grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese into the sauce. Stir constantly to ensure the cheese melts completely, resulting in a creamy and cheesy consistency. The combination of mozzarella and Parmesan will give the sauce a deliciously smooth and rich flavor. If the sauce becomes too thick, gradually add a little of the reserved pasta water to thin it out, until the sauce reaches your preferred consistency.
            
                Add the drained pasta to the sauce and toss gently to coat each piece of pasta evenly with the creamy tomato sauce. Allow the pasta to soak in the sauce for another 2-3 minutes over low heat, so the pasta can absorb all the flavors.
            
                Serve the cheesy tomato pasta hot, garnished with freshly chopped basil leaves and a generous sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. For an extra touch, drizzle a little more olive oil on top to add shine and flavor. If you like some heat, sprinkle a pinch of red pepper flakes for a spicy kick.
            
                This cheesy tomato pasta is rich, comforting, and packed with flavor. It's the perfect dish to enjoy on a cozy evening. Serve with a side of garlic bread to scoop up the extra sauce, or a fresh green salad to balance the richness of the dish. You can also pair it with a glass of red wine like Chianti for a complete meal. üçùüßÄüçÖ
            
                Pro Tip: You can add extra ingredients like saut√©ed mushrooms, spinach, or grilled chicken to the pasta to make it even more filling and flavorful. If you're a fan of extra cheese, try mixing in some ricotta or goat cheese for added creaminess.
